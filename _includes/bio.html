<h2>Short Bio</h2>
<p>I am a cryptographer working as an Engineering Manager at <a href="https://www.dfinity.org">DFINITY</a>. Previously, I was a researcher in the <a href="https://www.iaik.tugraz.at/research-area/crypto/">Cryptology and Cryptographic Security</a> group at <a href="https://www.iaik.tugraz.at">IAIK</a>, <a href="http://www.tugraz.at">Graz University of Technology</a>. My main research interests are in the field of provably secure public key cryptography, with a focus on cryptographically addressing security and privacy issues in modern computing scenarios (e.g., cloud computing or Blockchains). This also includes work on primitives, conjectured to remain secure in the advent of sufficiently powerful quantum computers. I hold a PhD degree (Dr.techn.) in computer science from Graz University of Technology, which I have obtained in 2017 with distinction. <!-- Before joining IAIK in 2013, I completed both, my master studies (Dipl.-Ing., 2013) and my bachelor studies (BSc, 2011) in Software Development and Business Management at Graz University of Technology with distinction. Currently, I am involved in various EU funded projects, focusing on privacy preserving identity management as well as secure and privacy preserving cloud computing. In addition to that, I am involved in teaching various graduate and undergraduate courses.--></p>

<p>I am a co-designer of the Picnic family of post-quantum digital signature schemes. Picnic is a third-round candidate in the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography">post-quantum crypto project by NIST</a>.
